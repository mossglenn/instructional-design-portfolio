            Staff working on this national biomedical research program are
            regularly asked <span class="font-bold text-secondary-500"
                >complex, highly technical questions</span
            > by members of the public. These questions often touch on genetics,
            data privacy, research ethics, and medical terminology. To respond accurately,
            staff must not only remember the correct information, they must interpret
            it, adapt it to context, and <span

                >explain it clearly at a wide range of literacy levels</span
            >. The existing training approach relied almost entirely on written
            resources, especially model respenses to frequently asked questions.

                When staff did practice, the feedback was often:

                In short, we needed a way to provide scalable, individualized
