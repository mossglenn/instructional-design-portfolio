                At the heart of the <i>All of Us</i> Research Program is a core belief:

            </div>

            <p class="my-3">
                To uphold this principle, the program required researchers to <span
                    class="font-bold text-secondary-500"
                    >go beyond the usual knowledge of ethical principles</span
                > to considerations like:

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside my-3">
                <!-- using set:html to prevent Astro Formatter (prettier) from adding whitespace--tried everything else -->

                    set:html="understanding the researcher's role in protecting participants' privacy"
                />

                <li>avoiding unconsciously reinforcing cultural stigmas</li>
                <li>sharing the benefits of discovery equally.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="my-3">
            As the program prepared to release its Controlled Tier dataset
            containing de-identified genetic data, an urgent need emerged:
        </p>
        <div class="font-bold my-4 p-3 rounded-md break-inside-avoid">
            Before researchers could access sensitive participant data, they had
            to demonstrate a clear understanding of their ethical
            responsibilities.

        <p class="my-3">
            While traditional human-subjects research training was available,
            many researchers viewed these courses as bureaucratic obligations
            rather than meaningful learning experiences.
        </p>
        <p class="my-3">
            Through consultation with expert partners, we were able to define
            the program's main objective for the course:

                    Program Objective
                </h5>
                This course will not only meet compliance requirements but will also
                inspire researchers to think about regulations as important guardrails
                to help them achieve their own goals as researchers when situations
                become complicated.
