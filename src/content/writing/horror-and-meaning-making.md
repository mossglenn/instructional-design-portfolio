I've been re-reading Eugene Thacker's *In The Dust of This Planet* and thinking about why horror fiction resonates so deeply right now.

Thacker argues that horror is about confronting the world-without-us—a reality that exceeds human comprehension and doesn't care about human meaning. The cosmic indifference of Lovecraft, the viral logic of body horror, the incomprehensible otherness of weird fiction.

What strikes me is that horror doesn't offer resolution. It refuses the comforting narrative arc where meaning is restored. Instead, it sits with the discomfort of meaninglessness.

And maybe that's why it works. In an era where every institutional narrative feels suspect, where cause and effect are opaque, where systems fail in ways we can't predict or control—horror's refusal to pretend there's a neat explanation feels honest.

It's not nihilism. It's something closer to negative capability: the ability to remain in uncertainty without reaching for false certainty.

Worth exploring further: how does this connect to learning design? Can we create learning experiences that build tolerance for ambiguity rather than rushing to closure?
