# Links to screenshots and what I like about them

## alfadev

light theme screenshot: .claude/inspiration/alfadev-astro-light.png  

what I like: I prefer the dark theme, but both work really well. This is one of my favorite inspirations I found today. The layout is clean and there is plenty of space. The typography is almost image-like in the way it draws attention and coveys energy and life. With the light aura around some text and spotlight highlights on the background, it feels bright while being dark. It reminds me of a stained glass window. I feels like the layout follows the standard ones (like flowbite layouts) but with a bit more personality and effort. 

## Breakout Learning

catelog page screenshot: .claude/inspiration/Breakout Learning-catelog.png  

what I like: This page has space for the ideas to breath, and the hero has an interesting and unique image. The contrast between the gray and yellow is energentic and purposeful. I also like the contrast between the size of the text and the really big qutation marks graphics around the testamonials page. The catelog page feels a little too crowded, but the images pop out as the thing to pay attention to and individualizes each item.  

## Cactus

what I like: I like the boldness of the whitespace, the power of the highlighted text, and the use of a single theme color really make everything feel intentional.  

## Cooper

what I like: There is a good use of whitespace so it doesn;t feel crowded but you can see several project cards at the same time on the screen. The semitransparency with white text over each photo is a good effect that holds all the cards together while allowing each to be an individual. The page title and the nav bar are clearly available, but don't pull your attention.  

## Orange

what I like: This one is bright and fun (maybe a little too fun). The orange and red gradients are very energentic (maybe too energentic). The fonts have plenty of contrast between the functions of the words. I like the way the subtle orange curved shape behind the hero image merges to become the background for the nav bar.

## Flowbite NGO

what I like: the layout is very clear because it leans heavily on standards (but maybe too much). I like the contrast between the rich, dark background and the stark white headlines--the headlines shine out without overwhelming the rest of the text. The images are bright and light as well (I'm not sure how well it would work if the images had dark background). The colors again remind me of stained glass or jewels without seeming to try to look artsy or fancy.
